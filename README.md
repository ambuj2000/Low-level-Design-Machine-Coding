➥ S — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- Each unit of code should have only one responsibility.
- A unit can be a class, module, function, or component.
- Keeps code modular and reduces tight coupling.

➥ O — Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- Units of code should be open for extension 
+ but closed for modification.

- Extend functionality by adding new code, 
+ not modifying existing code.

- Useful in component-based systems like a React frontend.

➥ L — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.
- Functionality in the base class should be usable by all subclasses.

- If a subclass can’t use the base class functionality, 
+ it shouldn’t be in the base class.

➥ I — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- Provide multiple specific interfaces rather
+  than a few general-purpose ones.

- Clients shouldn’t depend on methods they don’t use.

➥ D — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.

- Use abstractions to decouple dependencies 
+ between parts of the system.

- Avoid direct calls between code units
+ use interfaces or abstractions.
